Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop the proof of concept for the machine learning based malware classification based on VirusShare. VirusShare will be utilized for the extraction of the behavior of the malware samples, which will be used as an input to the machine learning algorithms. The goal is to determine the best feature representation method and how the features should be extracted, the most accurate algorithm that can distinguish the malware families with the lowest error rate. The accuracy will be measured both for the case of detection of wheher the file is malicious and for the case of classification of the file to the malware family. The accuracy of the obtained results will also be assessed in relation to current scoring implemented in VirusShare, and the decision of which method performs better will be made.


Algorithms Used:
Random Forest:
Random Forest is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms. It requires almost no data preparation and modeling but usually results in accurate results. Random Forests are based on the decision trees described in the previous section. More specifically, Random Forests are the collections of decision trees, producing a better prediction accuracy. That is why it is called a ’forest’ – it is basically a set of decision trees.
Gradient Boost:
Gradient Boost is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.


Dataset:
The Dataset used in our Malware Detection project consists of 137,000 samples. 41,000 binaries (exe, dll files) are not a malware file. 96,000 samples which are virus infected are taken form virusshare.com.
